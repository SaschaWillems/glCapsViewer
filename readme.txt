## About ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OpenGL Hardware Capability Viewer collects information on your graphics card
curretn OpenGL implementation, including hardware capabilities, extension,
compressed texture formats, etc. and displays them in an easy to browse way.

This data can then be uploaded to an only database that developers can use
to check on OpenGL features and support for different graphics card on the market.

The online database is available at http://opengl.delphigl.de   	   

Note that I develop this tool (and the database) in my spare time and that this
is no commercial grade product. So if you find any bugs please mail me or create
an issue at the github repositry (see below).
